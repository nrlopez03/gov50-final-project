## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to changes in voting patterns over time. Specifically, I would be interested in attempting to identify factors (or at least correlations) between changing aspects of a local area (economy, ethnic breakdown, education levels, etc.) and patterns in the party of officers chosen to represent that area (elected congressman, mayors, etc.). This could be done on a local, city-wide scale as well as a state-wide scale. I believe some very interesting patterns and correlations would arise.
